# vf-child

This project is a template to easily make use of core Visual Framework patterns,
override them, and add your own.

Why use a child theme? So you can programatically use (and update from)
Visual Framework core patterns, while maintain complete flexibility in the look
and function of your patterns (in addition to the Visual Framework's style
isolation principles (add link)).

## Take a few minutes to read the basics of the Visual Framework;


## Clone the Visual Framework Child Theme template

(todo: link to vf-core guide on installing dev dependencies)

- `git clone git@github.com: ... .git` (add repo url once ready)
- `cd vf-child`
- `npm install`

## Set your project title

Open `factal.js` and change

```
fractal.set('project.title', 'Visual Framework Child Theme');
```

## Launch the local pattern library

`gulp dev`

## Make and edit patterns

### Override `vf-core` patterns;

### Learn how to create new patterns;

## Customise the layout of the pattern library by editing the Fractal theme in `tools/frctl-mandelbrot-vf-subtheme`;

## Put your patterns into use

### Generate CSS and JS for your website

### Consume patterns as Sass

Follow example in `assets/scss/styles.scss`

### Deploy your pattern library

### Contribute new patterns back to the global `vf-core`;
